## Development Approach

- We used **React Context** to manage shared state (e.g. job data, filters).
- API integration was abstracted into dedicated services for maintainability.
- The UI follows **Arbetsf√∂rmedlingen‚Äôs design principles** for accessibility and structure.
- Each component is modular, reusable, and strongly typed with TypeScript.
